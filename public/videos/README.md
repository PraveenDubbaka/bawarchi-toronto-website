# Video Download Instructions

I've updated your hero banner to support video! Here's how to add it:

## Quick Steps:

1. **Visit Pexels**: https://www.pexels.com/video/indian-food-3298638/
   - Or search for "indian food" videos

2. **Download**: Click "Free Download" → Choose HD (1920x1080)

3. **Rename**: Rename the downloaded file to: `indian-food-hero.mp4`

4. **Place**: Put it in: `/public/videos/indian-food-hero.mp4`

5. **Build & Deploy**: I'll then build and deploy with:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
   ```

## What's Ready:

✅ Video support added to hero banner
✅ Autoplay, muted, loop functionality
✅ Seamless transition between images and video
✅ Video will be slide #3 (between biryani and thali)

## Current Slide Order:
1. Spices (image)
2. Biryani (image)
3. **Video** ← Your video will go here!
4. Thali (image)
5. Curry (image)

Once you add the video file, let me know and I'll deploy it!
